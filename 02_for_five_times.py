# In code, a for statement looks something like for i in range(5):
# and always includes the following:

# The for keyword
# A variable name
# The in keyword
# A call to the range() method with up to three integers passed to it
# A colon
# Starting on the next line, an indented block of code (called the for clause)

print('My name is')
for i in range(5):
    print('Jan Five Times (' + str(i) + ')')

print(i)
