# There are four rules to tell whether a variable is in a local scope or global scope:

# 1. If a variable is being used in the global scope (that is, outside of all functions), then it is always a global variable.
# 2. If there is a global statement for that variable in a function, it is a global variable.
# 3. Otherwise, if the variable is used in an assignment statement in the function, it is a local variable.
# 4. But if the variable is not used in an assignment statement, it is a global variable.


def spam():
    global eggs
    eggs = 'spam'  # this is the global


def bacon():
    eggs = 'bacon'  # this is a local


def ham():
    print(eggs)  # this is the global


eggs = 42  # this is the global

spam()
print(eggs)
